# Central Bibliography v0.1

Status: **implemented current source-metadata contract**.

`references/bibliography.yaml` is the canonical registry for papers, code,
documentation, specifications, and local source artifacts cited anywhere in
the explainer. Source metadata has one owner; architecture and pseudocode
files describe why a source supports a particular fact.

## Ownership

The bibliography owns source identity and descriptive metadata:

```yaml
schema_version: bibliography-v0.1
sources:
  - id: example_paper
    kind: paper
    title: An Example Method
    authors: [A. Author, B. Author]
    year: 2025
    identifiers:
      arxiv: "2501.00001"
    url: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00001
```

Architecture facts own citation meaning, local evidence locators, and notes:

```yaml
evidence:
  status: confirmed_from_paper
  refs:
    - source_ref: example_paper
      role: supporting_evidence
      locator: "Sec. 3.2"
      note: The conditioning vector produces adaptive normalization parameters.
```

Every citation role is a stable snake_case edge type. Roles are intentionally
extensible. Common roles include:

- `architecture_description`: the source describes the model as a whole.
- `reference_implementation`: the source is an implementation associated with
  the architecture.
- `implementation_evidence`: a code location directly supports the local fact.
- `supporting_evidence`: a paper or document directly supports the local fact.
- `specification`: a protocol or specification defines the local contract.
- `method_precedent`: the source demonstrates an earlier related method.
- `method_origin`: the source is evidence for an explicit, verified origin
  claim.

The role does not replace the evidence status. `confirmed_from_code` says how
the fact was checked; `implementation_evidence` says why that particular
source is attached.

## Historical Attribution

“This architecture uses AdaLN” and “this paper first introduced AdaLN” are
different facts. The usage belongs to the architecture's conditioning entry.
The historical statement belongs in a named claim with its own evidence:

```yaml
claims:
  - id: adaptive_normalization_origin
    statement: The cited work introduced adaptive normalization for this use.
    evidence:
      status: confirmed_from_paper
      refs:
        - source_ref: foundational_paper
          role: method_origin
          locator: "Sec. 3"
```

Do not infer “first” merely because a model cites an earlier paper. Treat it as
a research claim: verify the primary source and, when needed, corroborating
historical literature. Use `method_precedent` while priority remains unclear.

## Graph Interpretation

The bibliography provides source nodes. Each `source_ref` occurrence provides
a typed edge from an architecture, module, relation, representation, claim, or
pseudocode fact to one of those nodes:

```text
architecture fact --implementation_evidence--> code source
architecture fact ------supporting_evidence--> paper source
historical claim -------------method_origin--> paper source
```

This is enough to derive an initial provenance graph without duplicating
source metadata. Method and concept nodes can be added later when comparisons
need relationships such as `uses_method` independently of citations.

## Validation and Rendering

`architectures/index.yaml` registers the bibliography. The linter rejects
duplicate IDs, malformed paper entries, missing citation roles, and unresolved
`source_ref` values. The manifest builder includes the bibliography in every
architecture manifest, and the audience detail dock resolves citations into
titles, authors, years, locators, notes, and links.
