# Architecture Explainer

This is a static, source-first prototype for explaining system architectures
as semantic-zoom boards and short source-backed stories.

The branch is intentionally domain-neutral. Architecture facts live in YAML
and Markdown sources; browser pages render those sources into diagrams,
focus panels, evidence summaries, and reusable standard-block views.

## Architecture Language

Source layers:

- `protocol/README.md`: status index for implemented and proposed design
  contracts.
- `references/bibliography.yaml`: canonical metadata for papers, code,
  documentation, specifications, and local source artifacts.
- `protocol/bibliography.md`: citation ownership, typed roles, historical
  attribution, and provenance-graph rules.
- `protocol/architecture-language.md`: YAML vocabulary for methods, modules,
  representations, attention patterns, relations, claims, and evidence.
- `protocol/source-validation.md`: strict YAML parsing, executable schemas,
  semantic checks, and deterministic manifest compilation.
- `protocol/id-evolution.md`: stable-ID compatibility and atomic refactors.
- `protocol/architecture-projection-model.md`: current projection contract for
  architecture hierarchy, scoped board projection, automatic edges, elision,
  provenance, and migration.
- `protocol/fact-ownership.md`: architecture-v0.4 one-owner rules and the
  interfaces derived from canonical relations.
- `protocol/architecture-coverage.md`: explicit top-down breadth closure,
  depth frontiers, and compiled non-percentage coverage reports.
- `protocol/architecture-comparison-protocol.md`: proposed comparison workflow
  and axes; not yet part of the compiler pipeline.
- `protocol/pseudocode-language.md`: YAML vocabulary for algorithm lines,
  symbols, source refs, claims, and visual scenes.
- `protocol/standard-blocks.md`: reusable visual/mathematical motifs.
- `protocol/visualization-language.md`: semantic-zoom board language.
- `protocol/renderer-architecture.md`: renderer stack and interaction model.
- `architectures/`: machine-readable architecture slices.
- `pseudocode/`: machine-readable algorithm or code traces.
- `standard_blocks/`: reusable block specs.
- `views/`: source specs for generated architecture views.
- `renderer/architecture/`: generated architecture renderer prototype.
- `schemas/`: implementation-independent JSON Schemas consumed by the Ruby
  compiler and future authoring frontends.

Stories should increasingly be rendered from these source files instead of
hardcoding every module diagram in HTML or JavaScript.

The current architecture-v0.4 / visualization-v0.4 contracts enforce the
one-fact/one-owner rule. Architecture sources own a strict module hierarchy,
typed value sites, canonical relations, semantics, and evidence. Boards select
a subject, relative expansion depth, exact visible occurrences, explicit
elisions/exclusions, and presentation overrides; they do not author semantic
edges. A shared build/lint-time projector derives direct, boundary, and
contracted edges with ordered relation provenance. Drilldown remains explicit
through `board_ref`. See `protocol/architecture-projection-model.md`.

Within the architecture source, relations alone own flow endpoints. Modules do
not repeat inputs/outputs; conditioning refers to one relation; scale
transitions refer to ordered relation paths; and state lifecycle groups refer
to concrete value sites. The manifest builder derives renderer-friendly
producer/consumer and endpoint indexes. See `protocol/fact-ownership.md`.

Architecture coverage is also explicit rather than guessed. The root and
every module declare whether their decomposition is complete, partial, a leaf,
or intentionally opaque. Child sets and coverage counts are derived from
`parent_ref`; compilation reports breadth scopes and depth frontiers without
inventing an overall percentage. See `protocol/architecture-coverage.md`.

For architecture-aware authoring, read `AGENTS.md` first. It defines the
source-first update order, evidence rules, semantic-zoom board conventions,
and renderer validation commands. The browser is the canonical audience
experience, not an authoring surface: update YAML or Markdown sources and
regenerate the manifests instead of editing a board in the page.

## Current Demo

Path: `renderer/architecture/`

The renderer hosts multiple architectures. `architectures/index.yaml` is the
registry of source sets; the page switches between them with the header
dropdown or a `?arch=<id>` query parameter:

- `?arch=generic` (default): the domain-neutral feature-refinement pipeline.
- `?arch=dit`: the Diffusion Transformer (Peebles & Xie, arXiv:2212.09748),
  rendered from evidence-graded sources. Its board demonstrates edge elision:
  decoder scaling and intermediate value sites are contracted into dashed
  edges with complete canonical relation paths; hover the edge port to peek at
  the hidden chain, click to pin.
- `?arch=genie2`: Genie 2 protein-backbone diffusion (Lin et al.,
  arXiv:2405.15489), covering unconditional generation and motif scaffolding
  from request preparation through the 1,000-step C-alpha reverse process,
  invariant single/pair encoding, equivariant structure updates, and PDB
  export.
- `?arch=genie3`: Genie 3 atom-aware protein diffusion (Lin et al., bioRxiv
  2026), covering unconditional generation, motif scaffolding, and binder
  design through task-dependent partial atomization, 100-step directional
  DDIM sampling, bidirectional single/pair latent reasoning, and equivariant
  structure decoding.

There is one renderer interface: the audience view. Navigation, location,
hover explanations, focus details, pan, and zoom all belong to that same
experience. The former legacy, edit, and tuning UI variants are retired;
`?arch=` remains the normal way to deep-link to an architecture, while
`?layout=elk` remains an experimental layout implementation rather than a
separate interface.

Conditioning badges on edges (adaLN-Zero, pair bias, per-item AdaLN) are
derived from the architecture `conditioning` section, never hand-authored in
views.

All registered demos are compiled through the semantic projector. The generic
demo models a feature-refinement pipeline:

- input records become item states;
- a context builder produces pair/context state;
- local item attention updates the item stream;
- item states are compressed into group states;
- a global refinement stack consumes group state and pair/context bias;
- group output is broadcast to item outputs;
- output heads emit task-specific predictions.

The example is not tied to a paper or biological domain. It exists to exercise
the design language: evidence fields, state semantics, conditioning modes,
scale transitions, compact nodes, MathJax equations, pan/zoom, and semantic
drilldown.

## Workflow

After changing YAML/view sources:

```bash
ruby renderer/architecture/build-manifest.rb   # regenerates manifest-<id>.js per registry entry
ruby renderer/architecture/build-manifest.rb --check
ruby -Ilib:test test/architecture_projection_test.rb
ruby -Ilib:test test/architecture_ownership_test.rb
ruby -Ilib:test test/architecture_coverage_test.rb
ruby -Ilib:test test/source_projection_integration_test.rb
ruby -Ilib:test test/bibliography_test.rb
ruby -Ilib:test test/strict_yaml_test.rb
ruby -Ilib:test test/source_contract_test.rb
ruby -Ilib:test test/evidence_contract_test.rb
ruby -Ilib:test test/manifest_reproducibility_test.rb
ruby -Ilib:test test/documentation_test.rb
ruby scripts/lint_sources.rb
ruby -c renderer/architecture/build-manifest.rb
```

If a JS runtime is available, also syntax-check the ES modules (they use
`export` and top-level `await`, so check them as modules, e.g. via an `.mjs`
copy):

```bash
cp renderer/architecture/renderer.js /tmp/explainer-renderer.mjs
node --check /tmp/explainer-renderer.mjs
```

Both scripts read `architectures/index.yaml`; register new source sets there,
not in the scripts. The registry also points to the shared bibliography;
architecture evidence should cite stable `source_ref` IDs rather than repeat
paper or repository metadata.

Manifest generation now runs the full source linter first. Current architecture,
view, and bibliography sources must also satisfy the JSON Schemas under
`schemas/`; duplicate YAML keys, unknown fields, evidence-status typos,
unpinned code citations, and stale generated manifests fail closed.

Serve locally with any static file server, for example:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8096
```
